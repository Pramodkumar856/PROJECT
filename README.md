# 👋 Hi, I'm Pramod Kumar Sahoo

I’m a **Data Analyst** who enjoys turning raw data into meaningful insights that help businesses make smarter decisions. I work with data using **SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel**, exploring patterns, building dashboards, and transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable stories.

My journey into analytics started with curiosity — asking *why numbers behave the way they do* — and it has grown into building real-world projects focused on customer behavior, sales performance, and churn analysis. I enjoy working with messy datasets, cleaning and analyzing them, and presenting insights in a way that both technical and non-technical people can easily understand.

During my experience as a Data Analyst Intern, I built dashboards and automated reporting processes that reduced manual work, improved decision-making visibility, and helped teams focus more on strategy instead of repetitive data tasks. My goal is simple:

> **Not just analyze data — but help people know what action to take next.**
